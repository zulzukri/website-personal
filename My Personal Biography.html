<p>My name is Zul-Amirul Muhaimin Bin Mohd Zukri and I'm 20 years old. Most of my friend call me Joe but my family call me Amirul . I was born on 28th February 2000 at Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia(HUSM) Kubang Kerian. I have 5 siblings including me, 1 brother and 3 sisters. As you all might guess, I'm the youngest in the family. I live in Kampung Salor, Kota Bharu Kelantan.</p>

<p>My father's name is Mohd Zukri Bin Abdullah. He's 58 years old. My father work as a agriculture officer. My mother's name is Rahimah Binti Mohamed Yusoff. She's also 68 years old. My mother is a attendant hospital. Both my parents have been dedicated their lives in raising the 5 of us and ensure that we become successful individuals in this world and hereafter. I thank God to have such great parents.</p>

<p>In this section, i will tell you guys some of my features.</p>

<p style="color: purple">CALM</p>
<p>One personality trait that i have is that i am calm. I have never gottne into an altercation at school or at any other place for that matter. I do not get mad easily, which i think is a good thing because if i was a hot head then i would be getting into a lot of trouble. What i have noticed is that hot heads always have problems with other people that are hot heads so i'm glad that i am not a hot head.</p>

<p style="color: purple">OPTIMISTIC</p>
<p>My other personality trait that i have is that i am optimistic. I'm just not a negative person even when i am upset or mad. There is always that one person in your group of friends that is negative and i hate it when they try and bring the whole group down. I always tell that one person to shut up and keep an open mind. Keeping an open mind about anything just makes you an overall happier person.</p>
